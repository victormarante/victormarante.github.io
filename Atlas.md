Step 1: You want to expand to higher tier maps. For this you need watchtowers and watchstones.
- Watchtowers: Found after your first tier 3+ boss kill in each octant
- Watchstones: Found after killing Conquerors of the Atlas.
Focus on the eight Watchtowers first. If you incidentally happen to kill a Conqueror and get a Watchstone, great! You've got a headstart on part 3.
Zana's missions will help you progress here, as will any source of 'random' maps that will give you maps in unexplored parts of your atlas. 

Step 2: First 4 Watchstones
- Maps exist at (up to) 5 different tiers. e.g. Beach is tier 1, 4, 8, 10 or 14 depending upon the version you get. Watchstones influence this version.
- Watchstones require you to kill Conquerors at certain minimum map tiers. 
- First 4 can be done at low tiers but ONLY in outer octants.
- To spawn a Conqueror, just run maps in that octant. The Conqueror will taunt you and their minions will attack you (first one will always be Baran)
- First round you will get taunts on your first 3 maps. After this you'll get an interface that lets you plan for taunts (you'll see it soon)
- Inner octants need Watchstones socketed.
- When you get your first Watchstone, more info will show up on your Atlas.
- RUN THE MAPS
- Once you have all 4 your Awakening Level will increase. This gives small bonuses on killing map bosses.

Step 3: First 20 Watchsontes
- Check the storage grid for each octant to see how many watchstones must be socketed in a region to spawn Conquerors there. Eventually this will go up to 4 in all octants.
- At any given point in progression, the only maps that can drop are as follows - maps can only drop at their current Watchstone level, and only maps you've completed on your Atlas can drop - OR maps adjacent to the map you are in.
- However, you don't need to have completed the map at the current Watchstone level.
- Take Fungal Hollow in Glennach Cairns. With no Watchstones socketed in the octant, it's tier 2 and competes with your other tier 2s to drop - but it can't drop unless you've done it, or you are currently in an adjacent map.
- But with one Watchstone, the 0-Watchstone version can't drop, and the 1-stone version (tier 5) now fights for your Tier 5 drops. 
- You can't get a 1-Watchstone Fungal Hollow (should you desire it to spawn a Conqueror there) unless the drop source can drop tier 5 maps. Importantly, you'll want to run tier 4+ maps to get it.
- This means the best way to progress is to first put one Watchstone in each inner octant. Then spawn a Conqueror in each and kill it. (8 watchstones)
- Then put a second Watchstone in each inner octant. Spawn a new tier of Conquerors and kill them. (12)
- Now put a third Watchstone in each, and spawn one more round (16)
- Finally, put a fourth in each, and spawn the final round in each inner octant. You are now at 20, and you'll get a chance to fight Sirus, the boss of the Conquerors. Don't worry if he kicks your ass the first time. You'll be able to get revenge. Chaos resist helps here.

Step 4: All 32 and Awakening Level
- Move to the outer octants and bring them straight up to 4 watchstone level. 9 maps per spawn, and you get to fight the conquerors there as well.
- Each round, you will get one more shot at Sirus. You can choose your Awakening Level each fight - 8 for max loot, 0 for the easiest fight (he's still not trivial at 0).
- You will also make progress on teh Awakening Bonus objectives.

Step 5: Sirus cycles
- You've now completed the core of the Atlas.
- You can continue spawning the Conquerors. Sirus will become available once per cycle.
- Or you can do other things - Shaper or Elder or Uber Elder, Niko's mine, or more.

The New Changes: Preferred Map System
- Once you complete every map in a region, you can bias map drops toward your favorite map in that region, making one map ten times as likely to drop.
- All Atlas bonus objective lets you pick a second, all Awakener bonuses a third.
- These stack additively.
